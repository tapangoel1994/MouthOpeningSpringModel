To generate figure 2d, first run the script "IndepedentOuterRingR4N8.m".
Then run the script "HeatmapGenerator.m"

To generate plots corresponding to figure S5, run the script "IndepedentOuterRingR4N8.m" but after setting the variables R (in line 19) and N (in line 20) to (2,4,6) and (6,8,12) respectively to obtain the different initial geometries for the network. Also set l0 (in line 40) to 30 for all simulations to generate data for figure S5. 
The heatmaps from the data generated by the above script can then be created by running the script "HeatmapGenerator.m".
